# WhatsApp Assistant

This repository contains a FastAPI-based WhatsApp assistant that interacts with users via Twilio API. It allows users to send text and audio messages, which are processed and responded to accordingly.
The bot utilizes various tools and APIs, including Twilio for message handling, Google Gemini for response generation, and WhisperAI for speech-to-text conversion.

## Features

- _Receive and respond to text messages from WhatsApp users._
- _Process incoming audio messages, transcribe them into text using WhisperAI, and generate appropriate responses using Google Gemini._
- _Utilize Twilio API for message handling and communication with WhatsApp users._
- _Integrate FastAPI as a backend server for handling HTTP requests_.
